# 🚀 VC Dogfooding Session Handoff
**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Session Focus:** Dogfooding Run #20+ - Continuous Executor Testing  
**Epic:** vc-26 (Dogfooding Workflow: VC Self-Healing Missions)

---

## 📊 **SESSION SUMMARY**

### **What We Accomplished Today**

✅ **vc-136 COMPLETED** - "Auto-commit completely broken"
- Agent discovered the issue was **already fixed** in a previous session
- GitOps and MessageGen were initialized in `executor.go:217-239`
- Successfully closed after verification

✅ **vc-169 AUTO-DISCOVERED** - "Fix MockStorage missing GetReadyBlockers"
- **The executor discovered this itself** while working on vc-136
- Priority P0 (blocks test compilation)
- Demonstrates AI supervision working correctly!

✅ **Filed 3 new issues from dogfooding observations:**
- **vc-170** (P2) - Stale sandbox worktrees prevent new runs
- **vc-171** (P2) - Deduplication constraint violation on closed issues
- **vc-172** (P0) - Next session pre-flight checklist

✅ **End-to-end execution validated:**
- AI Assessment (confidence scoring, effort estimation)
- Agent spawning and execution
- Discovered issue detection and filing
- Deduplication (though found a bug)
- Graceful shutdown handling

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATE**

### **Metrics (Updated 2025-10-25)**
```
Total Issues:      172
Open:              85

Avg Lead Time:     3.6 hours
```

### **Dogfooding Progress (vc-26)**
```
Total missions:           ~20
Successful missions:      12+ (including today's vc-136)
Quality gate pass rate:   90.9% ✅ (threshold met!)

## 🔴 **CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Address Next)**

### **1. vc-169 [P0] - Fix MockStorage missing GetReadyBlockers**
**Status:** Open (was in_progress, released after executor shutdown)  
**Priority:** P0 - BLOCKS ALL MISSION PACKAGE TESTS

**Problem:**
```go
*MockStorage does not implement "storage.Storage" 
(missing method GetReadyBlockers)
```

**Impact:**
- Mission package tests won't compile
- Blocks any mission-related development
- Auto-discovered by the executor itself! 🎉

**Fix:** Add `GetReadyBlockers()` method to `internal/storage/mock.go`

**Options:**
- Let executor fix it (run `./vc execute`)
- Fix manually (5-line change)

---

### **2. vc-170 [P2] - Stale sandbox worktrees prevent new executor runs**
**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** P2 - BREAKS SANDBOX ISOLATION

**Problem:**
Sandboxes are not cleaned up after successful execution. Subsequent runs fail:
```
Warning: failed to create sandbox: worktree path already exists: 
.sandboxes/mission-vc-136
```

**Impact:**
- Executor falls back to main workspace
- Sandbox isolation broken after first run
- Must manually clean up before each run

**Workaround (REQUIRED BEFORE EACH RUN):**
```bash
rm -rf .sandboxes/*
```

**Root Cause:**
Cleanup only runs on failure, not success. Check `SandboxManager` cleanup logic.

---

### **3. vc-171 [P2] - Deduplication constraint violation**
**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** P2 - DATABASE INTEGRITY ISSUE

**Problem:**
When dedup finds a duplicate of a **closed** issue, it tries to mark the new discovery as blocked, causing:
```
warning: failed to update issue to blocked: CHECK constraint failed: 
(status = 'closed') = (closed_at IS NOT NULL)
```

**Impact:**
- Database constraint violations
- Log spam during analysis
- Unclear what happens to discovered issues

**Fix:** Check if duplicate target is closed before marking as blocked (in `result_dedup.go`)

---

## ✅ **WORKING WELL**

### **Executor Features Validated**
✅ Ready work selection (atomic claiming)  
✅ AI Assessment (confidence, effort estimation)  
✅ Agent spawning and execution  
✅ Structured report parsing  
✅ Discovered issue detection  
✅ Deduplication (mostly - vc-171 is minor bug)  
✅ Graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C handling)  
✅ Event cleanup goroutine  
✅ Watchdog monitoring  
✅ Circuit breaker

### **AI Supervision Highlights**
- **Confidence scoring:** 0.75 for vc-136 (accurate!)
- **Effort estimation:** 45 minutes (reasonable)
- **Issue discovery:** Auto-filed vc-169 when hitting blocker
- **Smart analysis:** Recognized vc-136 was already fixed

---

## 📋 **NEXT SESSION: START HERE**

### **Pre-Flight Checklist**
```bash
# 1. Clean up stale sandboxes (REQUIRED until vc-170 fixed)
rm -rf .sandboxes/*

# 2. Check what's ready
bd ready --limit 10

# 3. (Optional) Review the next session guide
bd show vc-172
```

### **Recommended Approach**

**Option 1: Continue Dogfooding (Recommended)**
```bash
rm -rf .sandboxes/*
./vc execute
# Let it fix vc-169 and continue with next ready work
```

**Option 2: Fix vc-169 Manually First**
```bash
# Quick fix to unblock tests
# Edit internal/storage/mock.go
# Add GetReadyBlockers() method
go test ./internal/mission/...
./vc execute
```

**Option 3: Fix vc-170 (Sandbox Cleanup)**
```bash
# Investigate sandbox cleanup logic
# Fix in SandboxManager or executor.go
# This eliminates the manual cleanup step
```

---

## 🎓 **KEY LEARNINGS**

### **1. The Executor is Self-Aware!**
The executor **discovered its own blocker (vc-169)** while working on vc-136. This is exactly the behavior we want:
- Hit a blocker → recognize it → file it → move on

### **2. Sandbox Isolation Needs Work**
vc-170 shows we're only cleaning up on failure, not success. This is a critical oversight for production use.

### **3. Deduplication Edge Cases**
vc-171 reveals we need to handle closed issues specially in dedup logic. Currently trying to create invalid dependencies.

### **4. AI Assessment is Accurate**
- Correctly assessed vc-136 as low-medium confidence (0.75)
- Reasonable effort estimate (45 minutes)
- Correctly identified it was already fixed

### **5. System is Stable**
- No startup/shutdown errors (vc-100, vc-101, vc-102, vc-103 fixed these)
- Clean graceful shutdown
- All subsystems (watchdog, cleanup, circuit breaker) working

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR NEXT SESSION**

**Minimum viable:**
- [ ] vc-169 fixed (MockStorage compiles)
- [ ] At least one issue completed end-to-end
- [ ] No executor crashes

**Good session:**
- [ ] 2-3 issues completed
- [ ] vc-170 or vc-171 fixed
- [ ] No manual intervention needed

**Great session:**
- [ ] 3+ issues completed autonomously
- [ ] All P0 blockers cleared
- [ ] Sandbox isolation working (vc-170 fixed)
- [ ] Quality gates pass for all executions

---

## 🚨 **KNOWN ISSUES (WATCH OUT)**

1. **Sandboxes must be cleaned manually** before each run (vc-170)
2. **vc-169 blocks tests** until fixed
3. **Deduplication warnings** about closed issues (vc-171) - non-critical
4. **Context cancellation warnings** during shutdown (vc-165) - cosmetic

---

## 📞 **QUESTIONS? CHECK THESE FIRST**

- **"What should I work on next?"** → `bd show vc-172`
- **"How do I run the executor?"** → `rm -rf .sandboxes/* && ./vc execute`
- **"Why won't sandboxes create?"** → Did you clean `.sandboxes/`?
- **"What's the dogfooding status?"** → `bd show vc-26`
- **"What's ready to work on?"** → `bd ready --limit 10`

---

## 🎉 **BOTTOM LINE**

**The executor is working!** It successfully:
- ✅ Claimed and assessed work
- ✅ Executed agents autonomously  
- ✅ Discovered and filed its own blockers
- ✅ Completed vc-136 end-to-end
- ✅ Handled shutdown gracefully

**Main blockers:**
- 🔴 vc-169 (P0) - MockStorage compilation
- 🟡 vc-170 (P2) - Sandbox cleanup
- 🟡 vc-171 (P2) - Dedup constraint

**Next step:** Fix vc-169, then continue dogfooding!

**Goal:** 8 more successful missions → 20+ threshold → enable GitOps → full autonomy
