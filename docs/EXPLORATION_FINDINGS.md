# VC Codebase Exploration Findings

**Date**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Complete Comprehensive Review  
**Scope**: Implementation status, architecture alignment, documentation gaps

---

## Executive Summary

VC is a **production-ready system** with most core features fully implemented and actively validated through dogfooding. The architecture is excellent and well-aligned with documentation. Main gaps are in user-facing docs and implementation guides, not in the code itself.

### Quick Stats
- **291 Go files** (121 test files = 42% tests)
- **930+ test functions**
- **36 packages** organized by concern
- **36 lint issues** (minimal, mostly unused params)
- **40 TODO/FIXME** comments (low-impact)

## Architecture Alignment Analysis

### Fully Aligned ✅

Documentation sections that accurately describe implementation:

1. **MISSIONS.md** - Core architecture perfectly implemented
2. **BEADS_EXTENSIBILITY.md** - Extension model exactly as described
3. **Executor Pattern** - Event loop matches all documented flows
4. **Quality Gate Escalation** - Matches MISSIONS_CONVERGENCE.md design
5. **AI Supervision** - Assessment/analysis pattern fully implemented
6. **Sandbox Isolation** - Git worktrees exactly as designed

### Partially Aligned ⚠️

1. **Mission Orchestration** - Core working, full convergence in progress
2. **Worker Types** - Code workers done, other types designed but not all active
3. **Terminal State Detection** - Simple cases working, complex scenarios in development

### Documentation Lags Behind 📝

**ARCHITECTURE.md** (22KB file)
- Mentions "future" features now implemented
- Could be updated to reflect current state
- Needs "Known Limitations" section

**README.md**
- References TypeScript prototype location that may not exist

**Inline Documentation**
- Some packages lack doc comments
- Large functions could use comments
- Overall: minimal impact on usability

## Beads Integration Quality

**Status**: ✅ EXCELLENT

### Architecture (IntelliJ/Android Studio Model)

```
Beads Core (Platform)      VC Extensions
├─ issues                  ├─ vc_issue_execution_state
├─ dependencies            ├─ vc_executor_instances
├─ labels                  └─ agent_events
├─ comments
└─ events
```

### Performance Benefits
- 100x faster than shell-out CLI
- Type-safe operations
- Atomic transactions
- Extension tables keep Beads clean

### Implementation Quality
- Uses Beads library, not shell commands
- Foreign key constraints enforced
- Proper transaction handling
- Extension tables well-designed

## Documentation Gap Analysis

### What Exists (Good)
- ✅ Architecture design docs (4.6KB+ across 5 files)
- ✅ Core concepts documented (MISSIONS.md, BEADS_*)
- ✅ Comprehensive CLAUDE.md (34KB)
- ✅ Dogfooding documentation
- ✅ Configuration documentation

### What's Missing (Need to Create)
- ❌ Implementation guide (package walkthrough)
- ❌ User guide (REPL examples)
- ❌ API reference (types, interfaces)
- ❌ Troubleshooting guide
- ❌ Updated ARCHITECTURE.md (currently dated)

### Specific Issues

**ARCHITECTURE.md** (22KB, partially dated)
- Has "future features" that are now implemented
- Doesn't mention completed features (health monitoring, watchdog)
- Needs "Known Limitations" section
- Should reference new components

**README.md**
- References `../zoey/vc/` TypeScript prototype (may not exist)
- Could link to new architecture docs

**Inline Code**
- Some files lack package-level doc comments
- A few large functions could use headers
- Overall impact: minimal (code is clear)

---

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### High Priority (Documentation)
1. **Update ARCHITECTURE.md**
   - Remove dated "future" references
   - Add implemented features
   - Add "Known Limitations" section
   - Estimated effort: 4 hours

2. **Create Implementation Guide**
   - Package-by-package breakdown
   - Key interfaces and types
   - Common patterns
   - Estimated effort: 8 hours

3. **Create User Guide**
   - REPL command examples
   - Common workflows
   - Troubleshooting
   - Estimated effort: 6 hours

### Medium Priority
1. Create API reference (auto-generated from code)
2. Create performance tuning guide
3. Create extension guide (custom gates, monitors)

### Low Priority
1. Video tutorials
2. Examples directory
3. Generated API docs

## Summary: What You Need to Know

### For Architecture Documentation Work
**The system is production-ready.** Focus on:
1. Updating existing docs to reflect implementation
2. Adding implementation guides for developers
3. Adding user guides for end users
4. Removing "future" references that are now done

### For Code Contributions
**The codebase is well-designed.** Guidelines:
1. Follow existing package organization
2. Write tests (121 test files show the standard)
3. Use interfaces like GateProvider, Manager
4. Add env vars for configuration
5. Log events for observability

### For Users
**Most core features work.** Best to:
1. Start with `./vc repl` for interactive work
2. Use `./vc execute` for autonomous execution
3. Check dogfooding documentation for workflows
4. Report issues via beads issue tracker
