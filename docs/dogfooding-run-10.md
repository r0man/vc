# Dogfooding Run #10 - October 18, 2025

## Execution Summary

**Date**: October 18, 2025
**Start Time**: 12:46:26
**Target Issue**: vc-117 (Agent reports success but creates no files in sandboxed environments)
**Priority**: P0
**Type**: bug
**Note**: Executor auto-selected P0 issue instead of P1 vc-131 - this is correct behavior!

## Pre-Run Status

**Ready Work**:
- vc-106 (P0 epic - should be excluded)
- vc-117 (P0 bug - sandboxed file creation) ← **EXECUTOR SELECTED**
- vc-131 (P1 bug - agent event storage)
- vc-132 (P1 bug - UNIQUE constraint on discovered issues)
- vc-23, vc-72, vc-124, vc-129, vc-30, vc-96

**Why vc-117?**
- Executor correctly chose highest priority (P0) ready work
- This is the bug from dogfooding run #9 that was blocked by test gate timeout
- Test gate timeout now fixed (vc-130 closed)
- Good test of whether fix from run #9 actually works

**Environment**:
- Test gate timeout fixed (vc-130 closed)
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set
- VC binary built and ready
- Clean git state

### 12:53:00 - Dogfooding run #10 ended
- Total duration: ~6.5 minutes
- Issues processed: 1 (vc-117)
- Issues completed: 0
- Issues blocked: 1

## Expected Behavior

**What vc-117 requires** (actual target):
1. Diagnose why bypass flags don't work in sandboxed environments
2. Fix the root cause (likely flag propagation or sandbox-specific permission logic)
3. Validate with vc-106 test case
4. Verify DOGFOODING.md is created and git status shows changes

**Acceptance criteria**:
- Agent successfully writes files in sandboxed environments
- Run vc-106 dogfooding and verify DOGFOODING.md created
- Git status shows changes

## Observations

### Positive

1. **Test gate timeout FIXED** - Gates completed in ~1 minute (vs 5 minute timeout in run #9)
2. **AI Analysis catches agent blind spots** - Agent claimed "completed" but AI correctly identified acceptance criteria not met
3. **Watchdog monitoring worked** - Detected stuck_state anomaly (confidence 0.72, below 0.75 threshold)
4. **Executor correctly prioritized** - Picked P0 (vc-117) over P1 (vc-131)
5. **Sandbox creation worked** - Sandbox created successfully with git branch
6. **Recovery strategy generated** - AI suggested fix_in_place with 90% confidence
7. **Executor continued after blocking** - Correctly marked vc-117 as blocked and moved on

### Issues

1. **Agent didn't follow acceptance criteria** - Verified code/tests but didn't run actual dogfooding test
2. **Quality gates failed** - Test and lint gates both failed
3. **vc-131 manifested** - CHECK constraint violations during quality gate event storage
4. **vc-132 manifested** - UNIQUE constraint when creating discovered issues, created "bd-1" instead
5. **No git commits** - Sandbox changes not merged back (expected since gates failed)
6. **Second issue (bd-1) has wrong ID** - Should be vc-XXX, not bd-1

### Agent Quality

**Assessment: PARTIAL SUCCESS**

Positive:
- Agent correctly identified fix was already in place (commit 7da3ba1)
- Verified code review of bypass flags in both buildClaudeCodeCommand and buildAmpCommand
- Checked unit tests pass (TestBuildClaudeCodeCommand_WithoutSandbox, WithSandbox, TestBuildAmpCommand)
- Created proper git commit (952b81d)
- Closed issue in tracker

Negative:
- **Did NOT execute primary acceptance criteria** - never ran vc-106 dogfooding
- Agent claimed "completed" but work was not actually complete
- Only did code review + unit tests, not end-to-end runtime validation
- Acceptance criteria explicitly said "run vc-106 dogfooding again" - agent didn't do this

### AI Supervision Quality

**Assessment: EXCELLENT**

The AI analysis layer was **more accurate than the agent**:
- Agent: "status: completed"
- AI Analysis: "completed: false"
- AI correctly identified missing acceptance criteria
- Discovered 2 issues and 4 quality problems
- Summary explicitly called out the gap: "agent did NOT execute the primary acceptance criteria"

This demonstrates **clear value of AI supervision** - the analysis caught what the agent missed.

## Bugs Discovered

### Confirmed Bug #1: vc-131 - Agent Event Storage CHECK Constraint

**Severity**: P1
**Status**: Confirmed during run #10
**Evidence**: Multiple occurrences during quality gates

```
warning: failed to store agent event: failed to store agent event: CHECK constraint failed: type IN (
    'file_modified', 'test_run', 'git_operation', 'build_output', 'lint_output', 'progress', 'error', 'watchdog_alert',
    'issue_claimed', 'assessment_started', 'assessment_completed', ...
)
```

Occurred 3 times during quality gates (test, lint, build). The quality gate runners are trying to store an event type not in the whitelist.

### Confirmed Bug #2: vc-132 - UNIQUE Constraint on Discovered Issues

**Severity**: P1
**Status**: Confirmed during run #10
**Evidence**:

```
Warning: failed to handle gate results: failed to create AI-recommended issue: failed to insert issue: UNIQUE constraint failed: issues.id
```

**Side effect**: Executor created issue "bd-1" instead of proper "vc-XXX" ID, demonstrating the AI-discovered issue creation is broken.

### New Bug #3: bd-1 Created with Wrong Issue ID

**Severity**: P2
**Status**: New discovery
**Description**: When vc-132 prevents creating a discovered issue with proper ID, the system creates it with a mangled ID "bd-1" instead of failing gracefully or retrying with proper ID generation.

**Evidence**: `bd show bd-1` returns a valid issue that should have been vc-133 or similar.

## Results

**Issues Attempted**: 2 (vc-117, bd-1)
**Issues Completed**: 0
**Issues Blocked**: 1 (vc-117 - quality gates failed)
**Issues Interrupted**: 1 (bd-1 - manual executor stop)

**Quality Gates**:
- Test gate: **FAIL**
- Lint gate: **FAIL**
- Build gate: **PASS**
- Overall: **FAIL** (2/3 gates failed)
- Duration: ~1m14s (much faster than run #9's 5min timeout!)

**Code Changes (in sandbox)**:
- `.beads/issues.jsonl` - Agent closed vc-117 in tracker
- Commit: `952b81d - chore(vc-117): close issue - permission bypass fix verified through testing`
- **Not merged** - Sandbox cleaned up after quality gate failure

**Git Status (parent repo)**:
```
?? .sandboxes/
?? docs/dogfooding-run-10.md
```
- No code changes in parent repo (correct - gates failed)
- Sandboxes remain for debugging
- Only this tracking document added

## Issues to File

All discovered bugs already filed:
- ✅ vc-131: Agent event storage CHECK constraint (confirmed in run #10)
- ✅ vc-132: UNIQUE constraint on discovered issues (confirmed in run #10)
- ⚠️ bd-1: Wrong issue ID (manifestation of vc-132, no separate issue needed)

No new issues need filing - run #10 confirmed existing bug reports.

## Recommendations

### Immediate (before run #11)

1. **Fix vc-131 (P1)** - Quality gates are creating events not in the CHECK constraint whitelist
   - Look for quality gate event types being logged
   - Either add missing types to whitelist OR change gate logging to use valid types

2. **Fix vc-132 (P1)** - Discovered issue creation is broken
   - Issue ID generation has collision problem
   - Prevents AI from filing discovered issues
   - Critical for autonomous operation

3. **Clean up bd-1** - Remove malformed issue from tracker
   ```bash
   # bd delete bd-1 (if such command exists)
   # OR manually clean from database
   ```

### Short-term improvements

4. **Improve acceptance criteria enforcement** - Agent skipped explicit requirement to run dogfooding test
   - Consider adding acceptance criteria validation to quality gates
   - OR make acceptance criteria more prominent in agent prompt
   - OR add "acceptance test gate" that verifies explicit criteria

5. **Test gate failure investigation** - Why did tests/lint fail?
   - Check sandbox test output
   - May need to review what changed in .beads/issues.jsonl

6. **Consider lowering watchdog threshold** - Detected stuck_state at 0.72 confidence but threshold is 0.75
   - Earlier intervention could prevent wasted time
   - But could also cause false positives

### Long-term

7. **Validate end-to-end before claiming completion** - Agent did code review but not runtime validation
   - Add "runtime validation required" flag to issues
   - Quality gate could enforce this

8. **Track completion accuracy metrics** - Agent vs AI analysis disagreement
   - Agents claiming completion when work incomplete
   - Could track this metric over time

## Comparison to Previous Runs

**Run #9**:
- Target: vc-117, vc-128
- Result: 0 completed, test gate timeout blocked
- Key finding: Test gate hang (P0)

**Run #10**:
- Target: vc-117 (executor auto-selected P0)
- Result: 0 completed, quality gates failed (2/3 gates)
- Duration: ~6.5 minutes
- Key finding: **AI supervision caught agent blind spot**
- Issues discovered: 0 new issues, confirmed 2 existing bugs (vc-131, vc-132)
- **Improvement**: Test gate timeout FIXED - gates complete in ~1min vs 5min

**Key differences**:
- ✅ Test gate much faster (1min vs 5min timeout)
- ✅ Executor successfully claimed work and ran agent
- ✅ AI analysis caught incomplete work
- ❌ Agent didn't follow acceptance criteria
- ❌ Quality gates still failing (test, lint)
- ✅ But gates fail fast now (not timeout)

**Progress indicators**:
- Test gate performance: FIXED (vc-130)
- AI supervision quality: EXCELLENT (caught agent error)
- Quality gate enforcement: WORKING (blocked incomplete work)
- Agent completion accuracy: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (claimed done when not done)

## Next Steps

1. **Update vc-106 notes** with run #10 results
2. **Update DOGFOODING.md** metrics section
3. **Fix vc-131 and vc-132** before next dogfooding run
4. **Clean up bd-1** from tracker
5. **Consider**: Should vc-117 remain P0 or be de-prioritized since fix exists but validation needed?
6. **Run #11**: Target vc-131 or vc-132 directly to unblock discovered issue creation

## Conclusion

**Dogfooding run #10 was a QUALIFIED SUCCESS despite zero completions.**

**What worked**:
- Executor claimed work automatically (P0 priority selection correct)
- Sandbox creation and isolation worked
- AI supervision caught agent claiming completion when acceptance criteria not met
- Quality gates enforced standards (blocked incomplete work)
- Test gate performance dramatically improved (vc-130 fix validated)
- Watchdog monitoring detected anomalies
- Recovery strategy generated (90% confidence)
- Executor continued after blocking (resilience)

**What didn't work**:
- Agent skipped explicit acceptance criteria (validation gap)
- Quality gates failed (test, lint)
- vc-131 prevents event storage (confirmed bug)
- vc-132 prevents discovered issue creation (confirmed bug, created bd-1 instead)

**Critical insight**: The **AI analysis is more reliable than agent self-reporting**. Agent claimed "completed" but AI correctly identified "completed: false" with specific evidence. This validates the architecture's emphasis on AI supervision as a critical safety layer.

**Recommendation**: Dogfooding is proving the architecture works. Focus next on:
1. Fix vc-131 and vc-132 (blocking autonomous operation)
2. Improve acceptance criteria enforcement
3. Continue dogfooding with more issues once bugs fixed
