# Dogfooding Mission Log

Complete historical record of all dogfooding runs. For current status and workflow, see `DOGFOODING.md`.

---

## Summary Statistics (as of 2025-10-24)

**Total runs**: 25
**Successful missions**: 14 (13 complete + 1 awaiting approval)
**Quality gate pass rate**: 90.9% (10/11)
**Issues discovered**: 12+ bugs (vc-148 fix + vc-149 lint issues)
**Issues fixed**: Multiple executor lifecycle bugs + **VC fixed itself (vc-148)!**
**Human intervention rate**: ~30% (improving, target: <10%)

## Key Achievements

### Architecture Validations âœ…
1. **AI supervision works** - Catches agent errors reliably (run #10: AI caught agent claiming completion when incomplete)
2. **Quality gates work** - Block incomplete/broken work effectively
3. **Watchdog works** - Detects stuck states and anomalies
4. **Executor works** - Claims work by priority, recovers from failures, continues after blocking

### Critical Bugs Fixed
- **vc-109** (Run #23): Executor startup cleanup - orphaned claims blocking work
- **vc-130** (Run #9-10): Test gate timeout fixed (5min â†’ 1min)
- **vc-102, vc-100, vc-103** (Run #19): Executor lifecycle bugs - clean startup/shutdown
- **vc-101** (Run #18): State machine context cancellation handling

### Process Improvements
- Activity feed monitoring via `vc tail -f`
- Automatic mission selection by priority
- AI assessment and analysis working
- Sandbox isolation proven
- Recovery strategy generation

## Lessons Learned

### What Works Well
- **AI supervision > agent self-reporting**: Run #10 showed AI analysis caught agent blind spots
- **Quality gates enforce standards**: Correctly block incomplete/broken work
- **Executor resilience**: Continues after failures, cleans up orphaned state
- **Watchdog detection**: Identifies stuck states before manual intervention needed

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Acceptance criteria enforcement** - Agents sometimes skip explicit requirements
2. **Agent completion accuracy** - Sometimes claim done when work incomplete (AI catches this)
3. **Issue ID generation** - vc-132: UNIQUE constraint failures on discovered issues
4. **Event storage** - vc-131: CHECK constraint violations on event types

### Investigation Discipline
- **Run #22**: False alarm teaches valuable lesson - check git history before filing bugs
- Stale data from old bugs can look like new bugs
- Manual testing (sqlite3, etc.) validates assumptions quickly
- False alarms are okay - they teach investigation discipline

## Recent Runs

**Run #25** (2025-10-24): **ðŸŽ‰ MILESTONE - VC FIXED ITSELF!** First successful autonomous bug fix. VC claimed vc-148, assessed it (95% confidence), executed the fix (25s, 4 turns), passed build/test gates, but hit pre-existing lint issues. AI supervisor correctly identified as "acceptable_failure" and escalated to human approval. Discovered vc-149 (lint blocking gates). Complete workflow validated end-to-end. **Full report**: `docs/DOGFOOD_RUN25.md`.

**Run #24** (2025-10-24): CLI smoke test (not real dogfooding). Moved to archive.

**Run #23** (2025-10-23): Found and fixed vc-109 - executor startup cleanup bug.

**Run #22** (2025-10-23): Investigation practice (false alarm, but valuable learning).
