# Dogfooding Run #25

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Executor**: VC (autonomous)
**Goal**: VC fixes bug in itself (vc-148)
**Duration**: ~2 minutes
**Status**: ‚úÖ Partial Success (requires human approval)

---

## Mission Objective

First **real** dogfooding run since switching to Beads. Have VC autonomously fix a bug in itself and run through the complete workflow: claim ‚Üí assess ‚Üí execute ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí gates.

**Target Issue**: vc-148 - Misleading --db flag help text in CLI

## What VC Did

### Change Made
**File**: `cmd/vc/main.go:73`
**Before**: `Database path (default: ~/.vc/vc.db)`
**After**: `Database path (default: auto-discover .beads/vc.db)`

### Agent Execution (4 turns, 25 seconds)
1. **Turn 1**: Read cmd/vc/main.go to locate the misleading help text
2. **Turn 2**: Edit line 73 to update help text
3. **Turn 3**: Verify change by running `go run cmd/vc/main.go --help`
4. **Turn 4**: Confirm all acceptance criteria met, report completion

### AI Analysis Summary
> "Agent successfully completed the documentation fix for the misleading --db flag help text. Changed the help text from incorrectly suggesting a default of ~/.vc/vc.db to accurately describing the auto-discovery behavior of .beads/vc.db."

## Quality Gates Results

### Build Gate ‚úÖ PASS
- Go build completed successfully
- No compilation errors
- Binary created successfully

### Test Gate ‚úÖ PASS
- All unit tests passed
- Integration tests passed
- Watchdog ran 3 anomaly checks during gate execution (no anomalies detected)

### Lint Gate ‚ùå FAIL
**Errors Found** (unrelated to vc-148 change):
```
internal/gates/approval.go:218:67: (*ApprovalGate).getCommits - result 1 (error) is always nil (unparam)
internal/sandbox/git.go:289:67: mergeBranchToMain - mainBranch always receives "main" (unparam)
```

**Analysis**: These are **pre-existing lint issues** in the codebase, not introduced by vc-148. The change itself (documentation-only) is lint-clean.

---

## AI Recovery Strategy

When lint failed, the AI supervisor analyzed the situation:

**Decision**: `acceptable_failure` (95% confidence)
**Reasoning**: The change is valid and meets all acceptance criteria. Lint failures are pre-existing codebase issues unrelated to this fix.
**Action**: Mark issue as `blocked` with label `needs-approval` for human review.

This is **correct behavior** - VC recognized that:
1. The fix itself is good (build ‚úÖ, tests ‚úÖ, change correct)
2. The lint failure is a separate pre-existing problem
3. Human approval is needed to merge despite lint issues

---

## Bugs Discovered

### üêõ vc-149: Pre-existing lint errors block quality gates (P2)

**Issue**: Quality gates failing on lint due to pre-existing unparam warnings. This blocks all PR merges even when changes are lint-clean.

**Impact**: vc-148 (valid fix) is blocked by unrelated lint issues.

**Errors**:
- `internal/gates/approval.go:218`: getCommits() error return always nil
- `internal/sandbox/git.go:289`: mergeBranchToMain mainBranch always receives "main"

**Fix Required**: Remove unused parameters/returns or add nolint justification.

**Workflow Performance**:
- **Time to Claim**: <5s (first poll)
- **Assessment Time**: 12s
- **Execution Time**: 25s (4 agent turns)

## Observations

### What Worked Perfectly ‚úÖ

1. **End-to-End Workflow**
   - Executor claimed work automatically
   - AI assessment accurate and fast (12s)
   - Agent completed task correctly (25s, 4 turns)
   - AI analysis recognized completion
   - Quality gates ran in proper sequence
   - AI recovery made correct decision

2. **Beads Integration**
   - Database operations fast and reliable
   - Issue state transitions worked correctly
   - Atomic claiming prevented race conditions
   - Labels added correctly (needs-approval)

3. **Sandboxing**
   - Git branch created successfully
   - Isolated working directory
   - Clean cleanup after blocking

4. **AI Supervision**
   - Accurate effort estimation
   - Correct completion detection
   - Smart recovery strategy (acceptable_failure)
   - Appropriate human escalation

5. **Quality Gates**
   - Build and test gates work correctly
   - Lint gate catches real issues
   - Gate timeout handling works

### What Needs Attention ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Pre-existing Lint Issues** (vc-149)
   - Blocks valid changes from merging
   - Should be fixed ASAP to unblock workflow
   - Not VC's fault - codebase quality issue

2. **Human Approval Workflow** (not yet implemented)
   - vc-148 is blocked waiting for approval
   - No CLI command to approve blocked issues yet
   - Manual database update required for now

3. **Auto-Commit Not Running**
   - Sandbox changes not committed to main
   - Intentionally disabled for safety (per DOGFOODING.md)
   - Will need human approval + manual merge

## Validation

### ‚úÖ All Workflow Components Work

| Component | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Issue Claiming | ‚úÖ | Executor claimed vc-148 atomically |
| AI Assessment | ‚úÖ | 95% confidence, 12s duration |
| Agent Execution | ‚úÖ | 4 turns, 25s, correct change |
| AI Analysis | ‚úÖ | Detected completion, 8s duration |
| Quality Gates | ‚úÖ | Build/test passed, lint failed correctly |
| AI Recovery | ‚úÖ | Correct acceptable_failure decision |
| Sandbox Isolation | ‚úÖ | Branch created, cleaned up properly |
| Database Updates | ‚úÖ | Status transitions, labels, events all correct |

### Fix Validation

The change VC made is **correct and complete**:

```bash
$ ./vc --help | grep "db string"
      --db string      Database path (default: auto-discover .beads/vc.db)
```

‚úÖ Help text now accurately describes auto-discovery
‚úÖ Users understand `.beads/vc.db` is found automatically
‚úÖ No functional changes, documentation only

---

## Next Steps

1. **Fix vc-149** (lint errors) to unblock vc-148
2. **Implement approval workflow** for human gate overrides
3. **Manually merge vc-148** once lint is fixed (or approved)
4. **Run #26** with a more complex issue to test multi-file changes

---

## Conclusion

**Status**: ‚úÖ **SUCCESS** (with human approval required)

**Summary**: Dogfooding Run #25 is a **resounding success**. VC proved it can autonomously fix bugs in itself, correctly running through the complete workflow from claim to quality gates. The AI supervision worked perfectly - recognizing that the lint failure was a pre-existing issue and correctly escalating to human approval rather than blocking the good change.

**Key Achievements**:
- ‚úÖ First successful autonomous bug fix (VC fixed itself!)
- ‚úÖ Complete workflow validated (claim ‚Üí assess ‚Üí execute ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí gates)
- ‚úÖ AI supervisor made correct decisions throughout
- ‚úÖ Quality gates caught real issues (pre-existing lint)
- ‚úÖ Smart recovery strategy (acceptable_failure + human escalation)
- ‚úÖ Discovered and filed real bug (vc-149: lint blocking gates)

**Why This Matters**: This proves VC can:
1. Work on real code (not just test cases)
2. Make correct changes autonomously
3. Recognize when to escalate to humans
4. Discover new bugs during execution
5. Handle edge cases (lint failures) intelligently

**Recommendation**: VC is ready for more complex dogfooding runs. The infrastructure works. The next test should be a multi-file change with tests to validate the full stack.
