{"id":"vc-244","title":"Update executor to use mission sandboxes for task execution","description":"Update executor to look up and use mission sandbox when executing tasks.\n\nCURRENT:\n- Executor executes tasks in parent repo directory\n- No sandbox context passed to agents\n\nNEEDED:\n- Before claiming task: GetMissionForTask(taskID)\n- Look up mission sandbox metadata from vc_mission_state\n- Pass sandbox path to agent executor (working directory)\n- Agent commits go to mission branch (not main)\n\nFLOW:\n1. Executor claims ready task\n2. GetMissionForTask() walks deps to find parent mission epic\n3. Load sandbox_path and branch_name from vc_mission_state\n4. If no sandbox exists yet, call CreateMissionSandbox()\n5. Execute agent with sandbox.Path as working directory\n6. Agent's commits go to mission branch\n\nThis enables all tasks in a mission to share the same sandbox and see each other's changes.","acceptance_criteria":"- Executor calls GetMissionForTask() before execution\n- Looks up sandbox metadata from vc_mission_state\n- Creates sandbox if missing (auto-create on first task)\n- Passes sandbox path to agent as working directory\n- Agent executes in sandbox, not parent repo\n- Commits go to mission branch\n- Tests verify multiple tasks share same sandbox","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T22:03:03.536449-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-29T11:26:24.045416-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-29T11:26:24.045416-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"vc-244","depends_on_id":"vc-217","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-28T22:04:09.032913-07:00","created_by":"stevey"},{"issue_id":"vc-244","depends_on_id":"vc-242","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T22:04:49.327473-07:00","created_by":"stevey"}]}
