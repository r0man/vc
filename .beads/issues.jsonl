{"id":"vc-232","title":"Implement IsEpicComplete() query","description":"Implement storage method to check if an epic is complete. An epic is complete when all child issues are in terminal states (closed/deferred) and there are no open blocking dependencies.","design":"Query logic:\n1. Get all child issues via parent-child dependencies\n2. Check all children are in terminal states (closed)\n3. Check no open blocking dependencies exist\n4.
