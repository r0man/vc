{"id":"vc-234","title":"Enhance GetReadyWork to return mission context","description":"Modify GetReadyWork() query to include mission context for each ready task. This allows the executor to know which mission a task belongs to and scope work accordingly.","design":"Approach:\n1. Extend WorkFilter to support mission-scoped queries\n2. For each ready task, call GetMissionForTask() to get mission context\n3. Return tasks with mission metadata attached\n4. Support filtering by active missions (no needs-quality-gates label)\n\nAlternative: Add GetReadyWorkWithMissionContext() method that returns enriched results","acceptance_criteria":"- GetReadyWork() returns mission context for each task\n- Executor can filter by active mission status\n- Query excludes tasks from missions with needs-quality-gates label\n- Performance: mission context fetched efficiently (not N+1 queries)\n- Unit tests verify mission context returned\n- Integration tests verify executor uses mission context","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:32:14.04027-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-28T19:53:29.143111-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T19:53:29.143111-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"vc-234","depends_on_id":"vc-216","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:32:23.778019-07:00","created_by":"stevey"}]}
