{"id":"vc-235","title":"Update executor to check epic completion after task execution","description":"After a task completes, check if its parent epic is now complete. If so, add the 'needs-quality-gates' label to trigger the next phase of the workflow.","design":"Integration points:\n1. In executor after task completion (processNextIssue)\n2. Call GetMissionForTask() to find parent epic\n3. Call IsEpicComplete() to check if complete\n4. If complete: AddLabel(epicID, 'needs-quality-gates')\n5.
