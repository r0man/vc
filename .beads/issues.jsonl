{"id":"vc-192","title":"Executor doesn't mark itself as stopped on graceful exit","description":"When the executor exits (either normally or via Ctrl+C), it leaves its instance record with status='running'. This causes cleanup to think it's still running until the stale threshold is exceeded.","design":"Add defer statement in main() to mark instance as stopped before exit. Update MarkInstanceStopped to handle graceful shutdown.","acceptance_criteria":"Executor marks instance as stopped when exiting gracefully","notes":"Implementation complete:\n- Added MarkInstanceStoppedOnExit() method to Executor that is idempotent\n- Added defer statement in cmd/vc/execute.go to call MarkInstanceStoppedOnExit\n- Updated go.mod to use Go 1.25.0 (matching system Go version)\n- Added test TestMarkInstanceStoppedOnExit to verify behavior\n- All shutdown tests pass","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-25T21:38:31.723597-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-27T00:00:15.509339-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-27T00:00:15.509339-07:00"}
